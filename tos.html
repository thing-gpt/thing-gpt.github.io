            AI Behavior Disclaimer
            
            AI is still in early stages of development. Not everything said by Thing-RPT and other AIs are accurate, and should not be taken as fact. These sayings may be
            Inaccurate
            Offensive
            Unpredictable
            We, AJ Industries, can not monitor the AI in real time. All moderation is seen after the AI has responded.
            
            Content Logging and Storage
            
            All services done by the users of Thing-RPT are logged onto a private database. All logs are deleted after a 30 day period. Please note that we do not sell this data to third parties, and that we only use it to analyze our users to see if they are eligible to use Thing-RPT.
